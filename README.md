# Sonic_Saturn
A fan-made, classic Sonic The Hedgehog game for the Sega Saturn. The aim is to create the sort of main-series Sonic game that I believe should have been made for the Sega Saturn i.e. a 2D side scroller just like Sonic 3, that also utilises the Saturn's superior power to that of the Mega Drive.
